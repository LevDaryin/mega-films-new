# Mega-films

Website for viewing information about films.

## Technologies

**Vite** is used as the build tool. The application is built on the basis of the **React** framework. **TailwindCSS** is used for styling. **Redux** is used for state management(along with **Redux Toolkit**). The application also uses **TypeScript**. **Ky** is used as an HTTP client. The **JSON-server** library was used to simulate the server.

## ToDo

- [ ] adding primary structure and styles
- [ ] requesting content from the server(films)
- [ ] content pagination
- [ ] routing
- [ ] films filtering
